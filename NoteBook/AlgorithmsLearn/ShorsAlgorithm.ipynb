    "Nowadays, asymmetric encryption is widely used in various fields, because of its complexity. Take the RSA2048 as an example, it is impossible to crack the private key for a classical computer since it takes hundreds of years to finish(Basically, it is about breaking down a semiprime). But for qpu, it can be very easy. This article will introduce why qpu can easily break down a semiprime."
